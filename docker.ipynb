    "The phrase “It works on my machine” is a common one in most offices with a data science department. It’s very common to write an application that works perfectly in your local data science environment only to find your colleagues run into problems with the exact same code.\n",

Docker is a containerization application that lets you create a portable virtual operating system environment, complete with your code and the custom package versions required to run it.\n",
